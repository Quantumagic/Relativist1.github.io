I am a graduate student in theoretical and computational astrophysics with the [Event Horizon Telescope](http://eventhorizontelescope.org/) and a candidate for a Ph.D. in the Physics department at Harvard University. I work at the [Black Hole Initiative](https://bhi.fas.harvard.edu/).

My research uses new cutting-edge approaches for [simulating](/_pages/simulating) and [imaging](/_pages/imaging) the EHT's black hole targets <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*">Sgr A*</a> and [M87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87). My primary graduate adviser is [Ramesh Narayan](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~narayan/), and I am also advised by [Shep Doeleman](https://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/people/shep-doeleman) and [Michael Johnson](http://www.scintillatingastronomy.com/).

I was born and grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I received a BA in Physics with a secondary concentration in Medieval studies from [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/) in 2013, and I earned an AM in Physics from Harvard in 2015. 

I also serve as a [Resident Tutor](https://dunster.harvard.edu/resident-tutors/) at [Dunster House](https://dunster.harvard.edu) in Harvard College, where I mentor and advise undergraduates on national fellowship applications, LGBTQ life, physics and astronomy courses, and paths to graduate school.

I am a proud member of the Astronomy and Astrophysics [Outlist](https://astro-outlist.github.io/) of LGBTQIA+ members of the astronomical community.
